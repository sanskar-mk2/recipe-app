		"description": "A light and tasty main dish. The tea and soup weave an elegant, fragrant melody punctuated by the pure white grains, while the unagi, baptized in coal-fire, provides tender, gentle decoration to the mix. The various aromas of eel and tea and the light sweetness of rice mix well on your tongue into something truly sublime. A triple threat not to be trifled with, indeed."
